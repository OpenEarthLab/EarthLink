    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Modern Earth science is at an inflection point. The vast, fragmented, and complex nature of Earth system data, coupled with increasingly sophisticated analytical demands, creates a significant bottleneck for rapid scientific discovery. Here we introduce EarthLink, the first AI agent designed as an interactive copilot for Earth scientists. It automates the end-to-end research workflow, from planning and code generation to multi-scenario analysis. Unlike static diagnostic tools, EarthLink can learn from user interaction, continuously refining its capabilities through a dynamic feedback loop. We validated its performance on core scientific tasks of climate change, ranging from model-observation comparisons to the diagnosis of complex phenomena. In a multi-expert evaluation, EarthLink produced scientifically sound analyses and demonstrated an analytical competency that was rated as comparable to specific aspects of a human junior researcher's workflow. Additionally, its transparent, auditable workflows and natural language interface empower scientists to shift from laborious manual execution to strategic oversight and hypothesis generation. EarthLink marks a pivotal step towards an efficient, trustworthy, and collaborative paradigm for Earth research in an era of accelerating global change.
