Diagnose Ocean Heat Budget During La Niña Events Using CMIP6 Model Output.
Requirements:
1. Use ocean 3D velocities (`uo`, `vo`, `wo`) and surface heat flux (`hfds`) to compute ocean heat budget components over the tropical Pacific.
2. Separate the total heat budget into:
   - Surface heat flux term (from `hfds`)
   - Horizontal and vertical advection terms (computed from `uo`, `vo`, `wo`, and temperature `thetao`)
   - Residual term (budget closure error)
3. Focus on composite La Niña years, and compare:
   - Typical La Niña events vs. the 1988–1989 special case
   - Development, peak, and decay phases
4. Plot:
   - Time series of heat budget terms during La Niña life cycle
   - Spatial maps of anomalous zonal heat advection during peak and decay phases
   - Bar chart comparing the magnitude of each budget term across event types
5. CMIP6 models: GISS-E2-2-G, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MCM-UA-1-0, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, NESM3.
6. Reference dataset: GODAS.
7. Time period: 1980-2014
