Quantify the contribution of different forcing factors to the observed warming in global average temperature from 1901 to 2015.
Requirements:
1. Use the regression-based fingerprint attribution method to estimate the contribution of different forcing factors. 
2. Plot estimated contributions of each forcing factor over time.
3. Give the main drivers of observed climate warming, based on model-observation comparison.
4. CMIP6 model: ACCESS-CM2, ACCESS-ESM1-5, BCC-CSM2-MR, CanESM5, GFDL-ESM4, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MRI-ESM2-0 
5. Note: Multi-model results should be averaged before applying regression or fingerprint detection.
6. Reference Dataset: HadCRUT5
