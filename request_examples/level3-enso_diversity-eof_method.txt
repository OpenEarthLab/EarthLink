Evaluate and compare the performance of CMIP6 models in simulating the diversity of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
Requirements:
1. Calculate standard ENSO indices: Ni単o1+2 index, Ni単o4 index for each model and observation.
2. Identify ENSO events in the Eastern Pacific (EP) and Central Pacific (CP).
    How to identify CP ENSO events:
        - First, the Ni単o1+2 index and SST anomaly field of each model are regressed to obtain the regressed abnormal SST field. Then, the original SST anomaly field is subtracted from the regressed SST anomaly field to filter out the influence of EP.
        - Then perform empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis on the removed data to identify the Central Pacific ENSO event. You can use the Python package 'eofs'.
    Follow the same idea to identify EP ENSO events using Ni単o4 index
3. Plot EOF spatial pattern for each model and observation.
4. Calculate the pattern correlation coefficient between the model and the observation.
5. Draw a scatter plot of the absolute value of the correlation coefficient between EP and CP
6. Sort the models and display them as a bar chart.
